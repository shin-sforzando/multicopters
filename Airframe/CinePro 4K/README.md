## How to

### Bind

The receiver/transmitter module binding will not have to be repeated, unless one of the two is replaced.

1. Connect the battery to the XM+ receiver while holding the F/S button on the receiver. 
2. The LED on the receiver will flash, indicating the binding process is completed.
3. Turn off both the transmitter and the receiver.
4. Turn on the transmitter and connect the battery.
5. The GREEN LED on the receiver indicates the receiver is receiving commands from transmitter.

### Failsafe

Failsafe is a useful feature in which all controls move to a preset position whenever the control signal is lost for a period of time.
XM+ supports failsafe function for all channels.
Follow the steps below to set failsafe positions for each channel.

1. Bind the receiver first and turn on both the transmitter and the receiver.
2. Move the controls to the desired failsafe position for all channels.
3. Press briefly the F/S button on the receiver (less than 1 second).
4. The GREEN LED will flash twice, indicating the failsafe position has been set in the receiver.

To disable the failsafe function, re-bind the receiver.
